            Growing up, my parents would buy individual chicken pot pies from the freezer section, and those had to be the highlight of our grocery shopping trips. The little pies came in small, aluminum pie tins with ingredient lists that took up the backside of the box. They were cheap, convenient, and kid-friendly.

        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <ul>
            <h2>For the pot pie filling:</h2>
                <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, sliced</li>
                <li>1 medium (1 1/2 cups) white onion, diced</li>
                <li>3 stalks (1 1/4 cups) celery, diced</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>1 rotisserie chicken, bones and skin removed, meat shredded or diced</li>
                <li>2 cups (about 8 ounces) frozen peas and carrots blend, thawed and drained of excess water</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, stems removed and roughly chopped, or 3/4 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, stems removed, or 3/4 teaspoon dried</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh sage, roughly chopped, or 3/4 teaspoon dried</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste</li>


            <h2>To assemble the lasagna</h2>
                <li>1 sheet puff pastry, thawed in the fridge</li>
                <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
                <li>Salt, optional</li>
        </ul>


        <h1>STEPS</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Once the butter has melted and begins sizzling, add the onion, celery, and garlic. Using a large spoon to stir, sauté the vegetables until they become translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. <br>
                    Reduce the heat to medium and sprinkle the flour over the veggies and fat in the pot. Stir the flour into the vegetables to create a roux, then cook the mixture for 1 minute to remove the raw, floury taste. The roux should look pale yellow and leave a thick coating on the vegetables.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a small bowl or large liquid measuring cup, combine the chicken stock and milk. Continuously stir the roux-coated vegetables while adding the chicken stock-milk mixture to the vegetables, 1 cup at a time. <br>
                    Once all of the liquid has been added, simmer the gravy until it thickens, about 5 to 6 minutes. The gravy will go from a thick, paste-like consistency to a smooth gravy that coats the back of your spoon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the gravy has thickened, fold in the chicken, peas and carrots, as well as the rosemary, thyme, and sage. Stir to completely coat the chicken and veg in the gravy.<br>
                    Taste the mixture and, if needed, adjust the seasoning with the salt and pepper. Pour the filling into a 9 x13-inch baking dish and allow it to cool for 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On a lightly floured surface use a rolling pin to roll out the sheet of puff pastry into an 11 x 15-inch rectangle that’s 1/8-inch thick. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and water to make an egg wash.<br>
                    Lay the rolled sheet of puff pastry on top of the baking dish. Brush the surface of the pastry with the egg wash and fold any excess dough over the top of the dough to create a crust. Crimp the edges as you would pie dough, then brush the fluted edge with more egg wash. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the surface of the dough, then use a knife to cut small slits in the surface to act as vents.
